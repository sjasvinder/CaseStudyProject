 # Project Title
 Airline & Hotel Booking web portal System
 By: Jasvinder Singh 
 
 # Description
 The objective of this project is to design and develop an airline reservation system. The primary function would be to enable a customer to book airline & hotel
 online. It will allow the customer to make bookings/search for flights & hotel under one umberalla by choosing the convenient source and destination places or by
 favorable dates. It shall also enable the user to cancel and print their itinerary. Each new customer will be required to register themselves and then login with
 their registered using login credentials which enables them to book Airline & hotel together as a pacakage. 



# How Does this Application Works 
This application enables the customers to search & book flights & hotels online.The Airline & Hotel booking system consists of two main types of users. The customers
who access the information provided by the booking web portal after registering with the application & the Adminstrator can perform the CRUD operation on the Database,
to update & modify the information by adding Airline and hotels in the web portal.The database  updated accordingly after any modification made by the Admin. This 
information can then available to the customers to book their flights. The customer can also have the option to cancel their booking any time.

# SDLC Cycle: Software Development Life Cycle
The Agile principles and Scrum framework was considered while working on this project along with the SDLC/STLC cycles during compile of this project. This involves
the following stages:

1.Requirement Analysis phase: Requirement Analysis phase has an initial phase which describes the current business processes and practices. It answers the question – Where are we now? User requirements were gathered before designing.

2.Software Design: After User stores and requirements gathered. The prototyping was put on the piece of paper. Before Designing this project, a list of questions such as why this project, project goal and target audiences were considered. The feasibility, code selection, pseudocode, wireframing and prototyping was initiated during Software design.

3.Code Development/Software Build: Once the Software design is done. The code development phase was initiated using chosen code and feasibility criteria. Frequent testing was done before completing the code and the actual code was written for the project.

4.Testing: Testing phase involves testing of the code against test cases once the code is built. Testing environment is chosen, and object of the application code is considered. Once the goal of the application and user perspective met, Code deployment phase initiated.

5.Deployment: This phase involves the implementation of the code.

6.Maintenance: There is always a space to upgrade and fix the code after implementation and we can always come back to upgrade the project as per Agile principles and values.

# STLC Cycle: Software Testing Life Cycle

1.Requirement Analysis: Requirement Analysis is the first step of Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). In this phase quality assurance team understands the requirements like what is to be tested. If anything is missing or not understandable, then quality assurance team meets with the stakeholders to better understand the detail knowledge of requirement.

2.Test Planning: Test Planning is most efficient phase of software testing life cycle where all testing plans are defined. In this phase manager of the testing team calculates estimated effort and cost for the testing work. This phase gets started once the requirement gathering phase is completed.

3.Test Case Development: The test case development phase gets started once the test planning phase is completed. In this phase testing team note down the detailed test cases. Testing team also prepare the required test data for the testing. When the test cases are prepared then they are reviewed by quality assurance team.

4.Test Environment Setup: Test environment setup is the vital part of the STLC. Basically, test environment decides the conditions on which software is tested. This is independent activity and can be started along with test case development. In this process the testing team is not involved. either the developer or the customer creates the testing environment.


5.Test Execution: After the test case development and test environment setup test execution phase gets started. In this phase testing team start executing test cases based on prepared test cases in the earlier step.

6.Test Closure: This is the last stage of STLC in which the process of testing is analyzed.

# Agile Principles And Scrum Framework:  
This project is based on the Agile Model and SDLC/STLC cycles. These values were considered right from the product planning and Deployment. The scrum framework was considered which is an integral part of the Agile. Agile has gained tremendous popularity because of its values and principles whereas V Model which is an extension of waterfall Methodology is expensive and meant for large projects only.The four core values & principles of Agile are:

1.Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

2.Working software over comprehensive documentation.

3.Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

4.Responding to change over following a plan.

This is the reason I considered Agile Model over V Model. Agile is an easy, simple, and inexpensive way to follow for developing Software

Airline & Hotel Booking web portal System is based on four steps of scrum which are: sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review & sprint retrospective. Following Agile, the more focus was given on coding & testing part. Scrum meeting was done frequently by me since this is an individual project. Whereas V-Model is a traditional  method that helps in getting quality of the product but very expense.

# How does a team (myself) become Agile?
The team make their decision based on Agile set of values and principles. Decision making process is how a team become an Agile. The values and principles have enough flexibility to allow the team in a wide variety of organization to develop the software to the way best works for their situation. By providing the enough directions to help the team to continually move their full potential.

# Scrum is a Framework of Agile Model 
It is based on rules, roles, events, and artifacts used to implement Agile projects. It is an iterative approach, consisting of sprints that typically only last one to four weeks. This approach ensures that the team delivers a version of the product regularly.
Scrum in Agile requires roles and responsibilities, including the following: (Please Note since it was an individual project & daily scrum and sprint meetings was done myself during the development of this project. It contains following members:

1.Product owner: The product owner is responsible for representing the customer’s best interest

2.Scrum master: This person is a facilitator, responsible for arranging the daily meetings, improving team interactions, and maximizing productivity.

3.Backlog: The backlog is a list of tasks and requirements included in the final product. It’s the responsibility of the product owner to create the backlog.

4.Sprint: A sprint is a set time frame for completing each set of tasks from the backlog. Two weeks is typical, but a sprint can be anywhere between one to four weeks   long, depending on the team and project’s needs.

5.Stand-up & Daily meeting Session: A Scrum project team is expected to meet every day to discuss progress. These meetings are typically referred to as a Daily Scrum     or Daily Stand-Up. Since this is a individual project stand up session was done myself right from the development and Deployment of the application.

6.Retrospective: Each sprint should end with a review meeting, called a retrospective. Here, the team reviews their progress and discusses how they can improve in the   next sprint.

# Jira: A Progress Tracking Tool
The successfully tracking of the progress of Airline & Hotel booking web portal application was monitored through Jira. This tool makes it easy for developers (myself) to locate, track, and record bugs within the software. All bugs and issues can be viewed in the backlog. With all issues in a single view, Jira makes it easy for teams to prioritize which bugs should be addressed first
